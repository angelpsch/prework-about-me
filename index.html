          <h1>Introduction</h1>
          <p>I used to be in JCCC's Web Development Program. I felt as though I was not learning anything and had no contacts for 1 year of being in the program so I graduated with my Associates in General Studies in December to look for better opportunities.</p>
          <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
          <p>I'm originally from Cedar Falls, Iowa.</p>
          <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
          <p>I have many hobbies. I build and create art/furniture/clothes/etc. year round. In the summer, I garden and longboard. In the winter, I snowboard.</p>
          <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
          <p>Honestly, if I could flip houses for a living that would be awesome.</p>
          <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
          <p>I currently live in Overland Park.</p>
          <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
          <p>I find I can put my design eye to work while challenging myself to strategically write efficient code. Plus it's the only career-worthy skill set I've enjoyed learning.</p>
